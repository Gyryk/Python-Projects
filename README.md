# Python-Projects
### All the smaller python problems I've taken on just for fun.
This repository contains all sorts of different problems you might encounter in an OA, on LeetCode, or in a class. <br>
Maybe this will help you solve some stupid problem you've been stuck on, only if you chose Python too though <br>
It's always fun figuring these out, hit me up if you have an interesting problem for me to code out, preferably something harder than what I have here. <br>
Might put the answers to every problem in LeetCode 75 should I find the time :)
